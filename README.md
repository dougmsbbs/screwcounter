Counting bowl meant for small shops to automate packaging.

   STL's were made in 123D Design. If anyone has a use for the design files send me a note.
   
   No promises on the DXF files. I did the design work in Corel Draw, and sometimes I have problems exporting them in DXF
and getting them to load in other programs. If you run into any problems with them let me know and I'll try again.

   I'm still getting the files around and getting them uploaded here. Please be patient with me! I'm getting there.
   
   I'm also working of a BOM and assembly instructions. Again, please be patient and I'll get it up as soon as I can.
